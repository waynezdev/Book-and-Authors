# Step - 1
### Starting point

- If you are reading this you have successfully cloned this lessons repo. **Go you**
- Run an npm install. We need to do this because we dont push up node_modules so we need to manually install them
- Run npm `run npm server` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors`
- Run `git branch -a` to see all the available branches. 
- You can check out to any step of the lesson by typing in `git checkout <branch_name>`
- Possible errors for this step
    - You forgot to cd into your directory before funning npm install
    - You forgot to cd into your directory before funning npm run server
    - There is something already running on 3000. Either choose a different port or run 
    `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill` to kill the port and then run `run npm server` again.

# Step - 2
### Creating a full crud resource
- Create a Show route for Authors: 
in routes.js add `router.get("/authors/:id", AuthorController.show)`
- Create a Show controller for Authors in the author_controller.js (dont forget to export the new function): 

```
async function show(req, res) {
  let { id } = req.params;
  let author = await AuthorModel.findById(id);
  res.render("author/show", { author });
}
```
- Create the show.handlebars for Authors in the views/author directory:

```
<h1>Author</h1>
<p>Name: {{author.name}} </p>
<p>Bio: {{author.bio}}</p>
<p>Gender: {{author.bio}}</p>
```

- Create a Link to the Show Author page. (Done on the index page)

```
<a href="/authors/{{this._id}}">View Author</a>
```
- Add a link to the index page for UPDATE and DELETE authors. To get you started here is the link you will need to delete a author. NB it is not attached to a controller or view yet.
`<a href="/authors/{{this._id}}?_method=DELETE">Delete Author</a>`

- Possible errors for this step 
    - Typos (its always a typo)
    - You forgot to export the show function
    - Using 'this.' instead of 'author.'
    - Not having the `?_method=DELETE"` on your link tag

### Step 2 Challenge

- Create the delete method
- Create an update method, and views

# Step - 3 Update and Delete for Authors
### Update and Delete for Authors

- The routes for the challenge:
    - `router.get("/authors/:id/edit", AuthorController.edit);`
    - `router.patch("/authors/:id", AuthorController.update);`
    - `router.put("/authors/:id", AuthorController.update);`
    - `router.delete("/authors/:id", AuthorController.destroy);`

- The controllers for the challenge:
    - Edit: Shows the form to edit the resource
    ```
    async function edit(req, res) {
    let { id } = req.params;
    let author = await AuthorModel.findById(id);
    res.render("author/edit", { author });
    }
    ```
    - Update: Updates the resource
    ```
    async function update(req, res) {
    let { name, bio, gender } = req.body;
    let { id } = req.params;
    await AuthorModel.findByIdAndUpdate(id, { name, bio, gender });
    res.redirect(`/authors/${id}`);
    }
    ```
    - Destroy: Deletes the resource
    ```
    async function destroy(req, res) {
    let { id } = req.params;
    await AuthorModel.findByIdAndRemove(id);
    res.redirect("/authors");
    }
    ```
    - Dont forget to export our new functions



- The views for the challenge:
    - Add the link to the author/index.handlebars page `<a href="/authors/{{this._id}}/edit">Edit Author</a>`
    - Create a edit.handlebars in `views/author/edit.handlebars`
    ```
    <h1>New Author</h1>
    <form method="post" action="/authors/?_method=PUT">
    <div>
        <label>Name</label>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="text" name="name" value="" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>Bio</label>
    </div>
    <div>
        <textarea name="bio"></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>Gender</label>
    </div>
    <div>
        <select name="gender">
            <option value="" hidden selected></option>
            <option value="male">male</option>
            <option value="female">female</option>
            <option value="non binary">non binary</option>
        </select>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />
    </div>
    </form>
    ```

- What if we want to add a different resource into this app? eg. What if we wanted to add in a books controller? The routes file would get very large. Node allows us to split out the file further. This is a "Garret convention"
    - Create a new directory in the root called routes. 
    - Create a new file in the routs directory called index.js. 
    - Copy everything out of the original routes.js file and paste it into the index.js file inside the routes directory
    - Change the relative path for the import of the controller
    `const AuthorController = require('./../controllers/author_controller')` 
    - This should still will work as is. But we can do one better
    - create a new file called author_routes.js inside of the routes directory
    `routes/author_routes.js`
    - Once again copy everything from index.js and paste it into author_routes.js
    - Then in index.js we can add this code. 
    ```
    const express = require("express");
    const router = express.Router();
    const authorRoutes = require("./author_routes");
    router.use("/authors", authorRoutes);
    module.exports = router;
    ```
    - This has set up our routes/index.js file to hold all our separate routes files.
    - we can now remove all '/authors' from our author_routes.js file

- Possible errors for this step
    - Forgot the '( )' at the end of `const router = express.Router()`
    - Forgot to export the functions
    - Having a plural or not having a plural where there should be one
